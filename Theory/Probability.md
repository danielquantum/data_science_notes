### Key Roles of Probability in Data Science:

1. **Descriptive Analytics** – Understanding data distributions using probability concepts like mean, variance, and standard deviation.
2. **Inferential Statistics** – Making predictions about a population based on sample data, using hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.
3. **Machine Learning** – Many models, such as Naïve Bayes, Bayesian networks, and probabilistic graphical models, rely on probability to make predictions.
4. **Uncertainty Estimation** – Probability helps in quantifying uncertainty in models, useful in Bayesian inference and decision-making.
5. **Anomaly Detection** – Probabilistic approaches are used to detect fraud or outliers in datasets.
6. **Bayesian Inference** – A powerful method for updating beliefs based on new evidence, often used in A/B testing and predictive modeling.

**Conjunction Fallacy**:
- Probability of a conjunction of two events cannot be greater than the probability of either event individually

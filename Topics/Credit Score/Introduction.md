	- less price sensitive
	- generate other incomes (penalties, insurance, etc.)

Example of default definition by Basel II:
- 90 days past-due-date
- a high probability of loss:
	- request a financial restructuring (extension, lower rate, etc.)
	- passed to the third-party recoveries agency
- a loss was incurred, either because:
	- write-off (WO)
	- sold less than the outstanding balance
